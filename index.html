      <p>I have taken Java courses in high school and college. I have created a few projects using this language,
          including an Android App that utilizes Wi-Fi peer-to-peer to share music.

      <p>I have used javascript a considerable in various projects and course work. Most notably I used js in my Desired States
        Configuration project at Principal this past summer. I was introduced to the language in one of my courses during my
        Junior year.

      <p>During Principal's Code Jam this past summer I needed to pick up python quickly and use it to create a data scraper for
        our web app. Since then I have created a few other data scrapers for my own entertainment using python. Besides that I have
        been doing various coding problems on the internet to improve my skills with python.

      <p>After learning MySQL in a databases course at Iowa State I have had the opportunity to use the language in a number of
        projects. I worked with a group of three other students to set up a database and use SQL statements to add and delete
        data in an Android App we created.

      <p>During my internship at Principal I had the chance to use php in our Desired States Configuration project. I lead the
        effort in connecting our front end and back end as I had the most experience with the language. We were able to create
        a solid foundation for the company to build off of once our interships ended.

      <h4>HTML/CSS/Bootstrap</h4>
      <p>My dad taught me html and guided me in creating my first website when I was in sixth grade. I created a website
        for National History Day which is a competition in which students are given a topic to research and then make a 
        presentation about it. I had a lot of fun making it and ever since have been interested in programming.

        <p>I started rock climbing the summer before my freshman year at Iowa State and have been obsessed with it ever since.
          I climb indoors when I am in school and take trips to go climbing outdoors my friends and I can. My favorite spot that
          I have been is Flatanger, Norway, which has some of the most beautiful climbing in the world. Some closer spots that
          are fun to go to as well are in Blue Mounds, Minnesota and Devil's Lake Wisconsin.

        <p>I love to travel and take the opportunity to whenever I have the time and money(which can be tough as a student). I've
          have visted a range of national parks with friends and family. I found out how much I want to explore Europe after I
          studied abroad my sophomore year. Besides Norway I have been to Poland, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands but I am
          looking to add more to that list as soon as I can!
