      <h2>About Me</h2><br>
      <h4>I am currently on track to complete my Bachelor of Science at Iowa State University in Software Engineering in
        December of 2018.</h4>
      <p>
        I was first introduced to programming by my father in sixth grade when he taught me html to create a website. Later in 
        high school, after taking some intro engineering courses and a basic Java class, I knew that Iowa State was the school 
        for me. I first declared Computer Engineering as my major but later switched to Software after my sophomore year. Since 
        coming to Iowa State, I have learned a laundry list of programming languages, various tools and frameworks that are used
        in the industry and secured my first internship at Principal Financial. I have also studied abroad in Norway and have participated in a number of 
        clubs during my time at Iowa State.

      <h2>Work Experience</h2>
      <!-- Summer internship at Cerner -->
      <h4><strong>Cerner Corporation:</strong> During the summer of 2018 I will be working as a Software Intern for Cerner at their
        Innovations Campus in Kansas City.<br>

      <!-- Summer internship at Principal -->
      <h4><strong>Principal Financial Group:</strong> I worked as an Application Development Support Intern on the
        ITSM and ESM Support Team during the summer of 2017.<br>
        <button class="btn btn-default btn-sm button workToggle">More</button>
      </h4>
      <div class="hideInitial">
      <p><strong>Main Role:</strong> Over the summer I redesigned and developed a business object for the ITSM and ESM support team.
        I worked with another intern to communicate with the product owner about the various business requirements and implement
        them in an intuitive way. After some training in how to use Principal's software and brainstorming for what should be
        included we were given the freedom to work on the project for the summer. The other intern and I delegated tasks and
        managed our time between working on this project and our other projects.
        <br>
        The most exciting thing for me on this project was that it was codeless which was not something I had been exposed 
        to before this. In addition to that learning curve I worked in an Agile environment and worked on a team with 
        experts in the field. At the end of the summer I worked with my mentor to put our project into production and was able 
        to experience other people at the company use what I had been working on.
      </p>

        <p><strong>Desired States Configuration Project:</strong> My second project was to create a web application to host
        settings for desired server states. I worked on this project with a team of 13 other interns split up into various roles.
        I worked on the front-end team for the project, using html and JavaScript for the most part, as well as a Principal
        specific bootstrap framework. I also took the lead in connecting the front-end and back in towards the end of the summer 
        using php. We managed to create a product that was a major improvement over their previous solution. After the interns 
        left for the summer Principal assigned a team to our project to expand on it which was their plan at the start of the 
        summer.
      </p>

        <p><strong>Principal Code Jam:</strong> Every year Principal conducts a code jam where they take all the IT interns
          and put them into teams of six. Each team is then given a project and they have four days to complete it, after which 
          all the teams give presentations on their respective projects.
          <br>
          My team was tasked with creating a data scraper for a team in the Principal Global Investors division. They wanted 
          us to find news articles that were relevant to business openings and closings, store that information in a database, 
          and then display it in a web application. I did not know python before we started this project so I had to learn it 
          quickly and then was able to create the data scraper for our team. After the teams gave their presentations ours was 
          recognized as one of the top three teams, in no particular order. Towards the end of the summer we had a meeting to hand 
          off the project to a full-time team at Principal that would be able to finish a production ready version of our project.

        been doing various coding problems on the internet to improve my skills with python.

        effort in connecting our front-end and back end as I had the most experience with the language. We created a solid 
        foundation for the company to build off once our internships ended.

        presentation about it. I had a lot of fun making it and ever since have been interested in programming.

        <p>
            I took classes that I was able to apply to my major at Iowa State, as well as study a foreign language, experience 
            new culture, make friends from around the world, and travel all over Europe. While in Trondheim I took courses in 
            Norwegian language, climate change, Differential Equations, and Norwegian history. I learned how to manage my time 
            efficiently while taking a full course load, and doing my best to travel and explore the country and culture as 
            much as I could at the same time. I made friends from all over Europe and gained insight in how to effectively 
            communicate with people from different backgrounds and whose first language isn't English. I'm very lucky I had 
            the opportunity to do this through Iowa State's study abroad program and I recommend it to everyone if they can.

        <p>I started rock climbing the summer before my freshman year at Iowa State and have been obsessed with it ever since.
          I climb indoors when I am in school and take trips to go climbing outdoors with my friends when I can. My favorite spot that
          I have been is Flatanger, Norway, which has some of the most beautiful climbing in the world. Some closer spots that
          are fun to go to as well are in Blue Mounds, Minnesota and Devil's Lake Wisconsin.

        <p>I love to travel and take the opportunity to whenever I have the time and money (which can be tough as a student). I've
          have visited a range of national parks with friends and family. I found out how much I want to explore Europe after I
          studied abroad my sophomore year. Besides Norway I have been to Poland, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands but I am
          looking to add more to that list as soon as I can!
